## Parker Jacobik
Hello, this is my earth data science portfolio! I am an undergrad at CU for geography and environmental studies and am most interested in working with environmental health data. I also hope to learn more about coding and mapping processes.\
I work at the Norlin Library Preservation and Conservation department mainly doing book repair, but I also restore maps and other media in the CU collections!

### Here's my work!
Map of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, CA \
One of my favorite third spaces in the closest city I grew up near. Going to visit the academy of sciences or having tea at the Japanese tea garden are must-tries when exploring the area!

[Denver Climate Data](https://pjacobik.github.io/img/denverdata.html)\
Colorado has a temperate, but continental climate that features  hot summer days, cold winters, low precipitation, and large temperature swings from day to night and high to low altitude. Denver, and the greater metro area, face multiple impacts from climate change other than warming temperatures. The area is at risk for increased wildfires, floods, droughts, and more intense and varied storms ([Colorado Climate Action](https://climate.colorado.gov/health-and-environmental-impacts)). Along with these issues, the people of Denver have continually faced water scarcity, from reduced snowpacks, and unhealthy air.\
The daily weather data used in this assignment was gathered from Denver International Airport where it is required to have accurate weather observations for aviation safety. In the first graph, you’ll see two significant gaps in the data. The first, from 1995 to 1998, is due to the weather collection site being moved from Stapleton Airport to DIA when it opened ([Jones for CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2023/01/23/denvers-official-weather-reports-come-from-dia-heres-why-and-how-you-can-help-complete-it/)). There is another gap from 2005 to 2014 that could be explained by a number of factors from quality or equipment issues to environmental events. Many of the months where data was taken to graph had missing maximum or minimum temperature values to reflect this. The January 1995 value of 23* F reflects the record lows recorded in Denver during the abnormally cold winter. The decline from 2020 to 2023 could be explained by the weaker human footprint on the environment during the Covid-19 lockdown. The second graph shows the trend of these temperatures over 30 years. It explains that temperatures in the Denver area have been rising over time, by about 0.18* F per year (3* F in the last 30!), and reflects the trend across Colorado where more warmer days and record highs have been experienced ([Ingold for The Colorado Sun](https://coloradosun.com/2023/09/07/denver-record-high-temperatures-chart/)).

[Mountain Lion Migration Data](https://pjacobik.github.io/img/bigcat_portfolio_code.html)\
Mountain lions (puma concolor) have the most extensive range of any terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. They are highly adaptable apex predators that can be found from the Canadian Yukon to Southern Chile. These animals are solitary but have fairly large individual ranges that can get up to hundreds of square miles with low population density. Their activity ranges from localized foraging to long-distance dispersal in these areas ([NWF](https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/Mountain-Lion )).\
Mountain lion territories vary according to the quality of habitat, availability of prey, and presence of humans. Their migration patterns are mainly influenced by where food can be found, mating opportunities, territorial dynamics, and environmental pressures from climate to seasonal change. ([Mountain Lion Foundation](https://mountainlion.org/about-mountain-lions/)).\
Observation data of this species is mostly collected thorough camera traps, GPS collars, and citizen science reports. These observations indicate that the species is mostly crepuscular, meaning they are primarily active at dawn and dusk. GPS studies have shown that mountain lions will move to lower elevations during the winter to hunt prey like deer or elk. Citizen observations have shown increasing activity near human-developed areas, which indicates habitat encroachment but highlights the species adaptability. Data analysis of mountain lion observation also shows that corridors connecting fragmented habitats are critical for sustaining the genetic diversity and resilience of the population ([Murphy et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989422001111)).\
The first graph shows WWF ecoregions that overlap with the recorded GBIF observation data for mountain lions. Notably, many ecoregions not in the species’ native habitat are displayed. This could be because of errors in location data, animals being studied in captivity like zoos, or misidentification for example. The graph below this one displays the specific observation points of mountain lions over the previous ecoregion map for clarity. This display more accurately depicts the range of the species with two outliers. We can assume the southern most point is an error while the eastern most point could be misidentified from an asiatic lion or an actual cougar in the exotic pet trade ([Fourage et al](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44353-025-00040-4)). The final map, seen below, takes the ecoregions in the Western hemisphere where mountain lions are found and displays the average amount of species observations by month.
