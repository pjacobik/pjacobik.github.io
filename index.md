## Parker Jacobik
Hello, this is my earth data science portfolio! I am an undergrad at CU for geography and environmental studies and am most interested in working with environmental health data. I also hope to learn more about coding and mapping processes.\
I work at the Norlin Library Preservation and Conservation department mainly doing book repair, but I also restore maps and other media in the CU collections!

### Here's my work!
Map of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, CA \
One of my favorite third spaces in the closest city I grew up near. Going to visit the academy of sciences or having tea at the Japanese tea garden are must-tries when exploring the area!
