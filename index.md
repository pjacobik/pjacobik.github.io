## Parker Jacobik
Hello, this is my earth data science portfolio! I am an undergrad at CU for geography and environmental studies and am most interested in working with environmental health data. I also hope to learn more about coding and mapping processes.\
I work at the Norlin Library Preservation and Conservation department mainly doing book repair, but I also restore maps and other media in the CU collections!

### Here's my work!
Map of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, CA \
One of my favorite third spaces in the closest city I grew up near. Going to visit the academy of sciences or having tea at the Japanese tea garden are must-tries when exploring the area!

[Denver Climate Data](https://pjacobik.github.io/img/denverdata.html)\
Colorado has a temperate, but continental climate that features  hot summer days, cold winters, low precipitation, and large temperature swings from day to night and high to low altitude. Denver, and the greater metro area, face multiple impacts from climate change other than warming temperatures. The area is at risk for increased wildfires, floods, droughts, and more intense and varied storms ([Colorado Climate Action](https://climate.colorado.gov/health-and-environmental-impacts)). Along with these issues, the people of Denver have continually faced water scarcity, from reduced snowpacks, and unhealthy air.\
The daily weather data used in this assignment was gathered from Denver International Airport where it is required to have accurate weather observations for aviation safety. In the first graph, youâ€™ll see two significant gaps in the data. The first, from 1995 to 1998, is due to the weather collection site being moved from Stapleton Airport to DIA when it opened ([Jones for CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2023/01/23/denvers-official-weather-reports-come-from-dia-heres-why-and-how-you-can-help-complete-it/)). There is another gap from 2005 to 2014 that could be explained by a number of factors from quality or equipment issues to environmental events. Many of the months where data was taken to graph had missing maximum or minimum temperature values to reflect this. The January 1995 value of 23* F reflects the record lows recorded in Denver during the abnormally cold winter. The decline from 2020 to 2023 could be explained by the weaker human footprint on the environment during the Covid-19 lockdown. The second graph shows the trend of these temperatures over 30 years. It explains that temperatures in the Denver area have been rising over time, by about 0.18* F per year (3* F in the last 30!), and reflects the trend across Colorado where more warmer days and record highs have been experienced ([Ingold for The Colorado Sun](https://coloradosun.com/2023/09/07/denver-record-high-temperatures-chart/)).
