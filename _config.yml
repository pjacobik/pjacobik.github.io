title: parkers earth data science portfolio
description: Hello, this is my earth data science portfolio! I am an undergrad at CU for geography and environmental studies and am most interested in working with environmental health data. I also hope to learn more about coding and mapping processes.\
I work at the Norlin Library Preservation and Conservation department mainly doing book repair, but I also restore maps and other media in the CU collections!
